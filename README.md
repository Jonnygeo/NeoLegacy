## 🧠 Philosophy

NeoLegacy isn’t just tech — it’s a resurrection of forgotten truths through code.  
Born from moral clarity and fueled by AI, this platform is your voice across time.

We believe technology should preserve the soul, not extract from it.  
That legacy is more than memory — it’s conviction encoded.
